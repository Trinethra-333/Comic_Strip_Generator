# 🎨 Comic Strip Generator

## 📌 Overview
The **Comic Strip Generator** is a web application that allows you to create AI-generated **4-panel comic strips** in different visual styles and tones.  
It uses **Google Generative AI (Gemini)** to create both **images** and **captions** based on your prompt, and lets you download the final comic strip as a **PDF**.

The project is built using **Streamlit** for the web interface and styled with an **aesthetic dark theme** for an appealing user experience.
